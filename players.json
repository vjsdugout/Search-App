        "bio": "Lionel Andrés \"Leo\" Messi is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for Spanish club FC Barcelona and the Argentina national team. Often considered the best player in the world and rated by many in the sport as the greatest of all time, Messi is the only football player in history to win four Ballons d'Or, all of which he won consecutively. With Barcelona, he has won seven La Ligas, three Copas del Rey, and four UEFA Champions Leagues, among other honours. As the all-time top scorer in La Liga and the Champions League, he is the first player to win three European Golden Shoes as the continent's league top scorer and the only player to be top scorer in five Champions League seasons. Born and raised in central Argentina, Messi was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency as a child. At age 13, he relocated to Spain to join Barcelona, who were willing to pay for his medical treatment. After an unusually fast progression through Barcelona's youth academy, Messi made his first team debut aged 16 in November 2003. Although injury-prone during his early years with the first team, he established himself as an integral player for the club within the next four years, finishing 2007 as a finalist for both the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award, a feat he repeated the following year. He played his first uninterrupted campaign in 2008–09, during which Barcelona achieved the first treble in Spanish football. At 22 years old, Messi won the 2009 Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award by record voting margins. Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning three consecutive FIFA Ballons d'Or, including his unprecedented fourth. He played his personal best campaign in the 2011–12 season, setting the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer in all official club competitions in March 2012."
